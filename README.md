Well, this is simple summer project started  so that I could get better with python, gtk, dbus, databases and all other stuffs. This project is in very initial stage right now. Lots of many features can be added to the application like:

	* Applications grabs lyrics from only one website as of now i.e `www.azlyrics.com`. Other sources can be added as well.
	* Preference class that will hold the necessary settings needed to run the application.
	* Improve the look and feel of the UI.
	* Extracting artist/song name by opening a music file.
	* Display the lyrics of the currently running song in amarok, rhythmbox, etc.

Lots of more features can be thought and added. Hopefully will be adding few of them whenever I get time.
